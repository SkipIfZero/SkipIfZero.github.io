# Blog launch

So with this much needed update of the website I'm also launching a blog. I'm planning on posting articles about graphics, programming and similar topics. In fact, I already have a couple of almost finished blog posts on volumetric lighting that will hopefully be up soon:ish. Beyond that I don't really know how often the blog will update or what I will write about, but hopefully something interesting will turn up.
