<h1>About</h1>

<P> My name is Peter Hillerstr√∂m, and this is my personal site slash blog. I'm a professional software engineer with an MSc in Computer Science from Chalmers University of Technology. My main technical interests are computer graphics, GPU programming, low-level optimization and games. </P>

<P> Outside of programming I'm a lover of fiction, movies, books, games, you name it. I especially love science fiction, both good and bad. </P>

<h2>My code</h2>
<P> A lot of my code is available at my <a href="https://github.com/PetorSFZ">github page</a> and at <a href="https://github.com/SkipIfZero">the github page of SkipIfZero</a>. For games I've finished take a look <a href="/games.html">here</a>. </P>

<h2>SkipIfZero</h2>

<P> SkipIfZero was the name of my 'company' I created when I started making games back in the swedish equivalent of high school. I was naiver back then and had fantasies about starting an independent game studio. That didn't really pan out (at least not yet), but the name still stuck. Nowadays I often shorten it to SFZ. </P>

<h2>Hiring</h2>

<P> I am currently employed as a consultant and not looking for new work. However, as a consultant I always keep my eyes open for new interesting assignments. If you have an interesting project you think I would be a good fit for, please feel free to contact me! </P>
