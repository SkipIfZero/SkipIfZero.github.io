<h1>About</h1>

<P> I'm Peter Hillerstr√∂m, and this is my personal site slash blog. I'm a student at the computer science master program at Chalmers University of Technology. My main technical interests are graphics, games programming and making code fast. In my spare time I like watching bad sci-fi movies. </P>

<h2>My code</h2>
<P> A lot of my code is available at my <a href="https://github.com/PetorSFZ">github page</a> and at <a href="https://github.com/SkipIfZero">the github page of SkipIfZero</a>. For games I've finished take a look <a href="/games.html">here</a>. </P>

<h2>SkipIfZero</h2>

<P> SkipIfZero was the name of my 'company' I created when I started making games back in the swedish equivalent of high school. I was naiver back then and had fantasies about starting an independent game studio. That didn't really pan out (at least not yet), but the name still stuck. </P>
