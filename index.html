			<p><h1>Current</h1></p>
			<p>
				The focus since the release of snakium has primarily been to brush up the programming skills in preparation for a move to c++ and games targeting PC. One of the main limitations currently is that I lack the artistic skills to make good looking sprites, 3d models and textures. If you're good at any of this and interested in a collaboration <i><a href="mailto:contact@skipifzero.com">please contact me. :)</a></i>

			<p><h1>Games</h1></p>

				This is a list of all finished and published games by SkipIfZero. Besides these there exists a lot of prototypes and unfinished games, some of those might someday see the light of day.

				A really nice snake clone. Features multiple game modes and very customizable rules, each individual rule can be adjusted! Regardless if you prefer the rules of old snake from Nokia phones or more modern rules this version of snake has something for you.
			</p>
			<p>Made in the summer of 2013 after my first year at Chalmers. Unlike previous projects I decided to focus on something smaller in scope and instead try to do it really, really well. The focus of snakium was to make it look really good and give it a distinct style and theme. Lessons were learned previous projects and much effort went into making the quick, tight controls of snake work on a touch device.

				Space Hunter is space shooter for Android. It was made during 2011/2012 as a school project. As it was my first 'real' programming project I didn't really have any prior experience and the process was very much trial and error. The end result still turned out quite nice in my non-biased opinion, but the source code is a huge mess and should better be left forgotten deep in a drawer somewhere. <i><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skipifzero.android.spacehunter">It's available for free on Google Play Store, so go ahead and try it out!</a></i>

			<p><h1>About</h1></p>
			<p>
				SkipIfZero is a one-man organisation dedicated to creating games and other software. It was founded back in 2012 when I was creating my first game, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skipifzero.android.spacehunter">Space Hunter</a>, as part of a school project.
			</p>
			<p>
				The name SkipIfZero comes from basic control flow of a program. An if statement skips its content if the argument evaluates to zero. It was also the name of an assembly instruction in a microprocessor I used to write code for.
			</p>
			<p>
				The long term goal is to expand and create bigger, more interesting games. Maybe even make a profit. If you're interested in joining or collaborating, <i><a href="mailto:contact@skipifzero.com">contact me.</a></i>
